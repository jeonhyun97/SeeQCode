### Visualizing the "quality"

**SeeQCode** not only focuses on checking the *amount* of the contribution made by each author but also visualizes the *quality*.


Candidate metrics (not fixed): 
1. Code smell -> redundancy, efficiency...
   - *per commit*
2. cyclomatic complexity, LOC, Maintainability index... 
   - *per method*
3. Test coverage 
   - *per commit* 
   - *per method*
4. Documentation 
   - *per method*
