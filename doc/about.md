1. Mama, just killed a [man](http://jeonhyun97.github.io)
2. Put a gun against his head
    - Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
    - Mama, life had just begun
3. But now I've gone and thrown it all away
> Mama, ooh
> Didn't mean to make you cry 

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

##### Rhapsody

Carry on, carry on
*As if nothing really matters* <br>
*Too late, my time has come Sends shivers down my spine*

*Body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth*
```
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
```
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
